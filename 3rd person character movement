This shows how to make a 3rd person character movement script.
Start off by creating a 3D Project as this tutorial will be using 3D dimensions and refernces.

1. Create a Scene
Start by creaing a new scene called camera movement.
You will need to set a few objects in the level to show how the player moves.
Make sure you have cinemachine installed(you can do this by going to package manager and finding cinemachine)
Next create a shape for the player character(anything will do).
Make sure you child another 3D object to the third person character and use it to show where the front of the character is.
Create an empty object and child both objects from the previous steps to it.
Rename the empty object to Thirdperson character and the shape for the player character to GFX.
Go to cinemachine and create a freelook camera and rename it to Third Person Camera
