Started working on my programming. I watched a couple tutorials on how to create an enemy spawner as well as the one i used for my tutorial. Once I got the enemy to spawn I then went ahead and watched a couple tutorials on how to get the enemy that spwned to search for the player and follow them around terrain and objects blocking their path.
